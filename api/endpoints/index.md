# Terrain Endpoints

All URLs referenced in endpoint documentation are listed as relative URLs with value names enclosed in braces.
For example, the service to get a list of workflow elements is accessed using the URL, `/get-workflow-elements/{element-type}`.
Where `{element-type}` refers to the type of workflow element that is being retrieved.
For example, to get a list of known property types, you can access the URL, `/get-workflow-elements/property-types`.
On the other hand, all examples use fully qualified URLs.

Request and response bodies are in JSON format unless otherwise noted.
